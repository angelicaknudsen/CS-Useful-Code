# CS-Useful-Code

Hello fellow Red River High School students!!! I recently learned about GitHub, which is a resource for tracking changes to your code. This also allows others to collaborate and view code online, which is what I mostly intend.

Even thought the scholarship competition will now be individual, I think it'll be nice to have a place where we can distribute code.
