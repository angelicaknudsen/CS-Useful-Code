# CS-Useful-Code

Hello fellow Red River High School students!!! I recently learned about GitHub, which is a useful resource for tracking changes to your code. This is also a useful resource for allowing others to collaborate and view code online, which is what I mostly intend.

Here you'll find simple code that will be useful for completing the Python-based challenges. I have yet to find the awesome brute-forcing password code that they provide, but once I find that in one of the challenges, I'll add that here.
